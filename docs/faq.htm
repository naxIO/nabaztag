<b>What does this site do?</b><br>
This site is one of several independent sites that provides service for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nabaztag">Nabaztag</a> rabbits.<br>
<P>
<b>Why the service?</b><br>
In July 2011, after several years of service, Violet, the company that made the Nabaztag, shut down 
their servers. After a few days of missing my rabbit and figuring it
was just another temporary lapse in service, I checked and discovered that they had closed and released their
source code.  I downloaded the source code and wondered if I could put together my own solution.  
<p>
The rabbit's code was written in an obscure language called Metal which was created by one of the company's
cofounders, Sylvain Huet.  There was very little documentation and 10,000+ files to sort thru but after a 
few weeks of nights and weekends, I figured out how it worked.  I created this site for two reasons. 
I did not want to run my rabbit from my Macbook, and second, I thought that there would be other people that
would like to hear their rabbits again.
<P>
<b>Who runs it?</b><br>
Me.  I run it.  My rabbit is named Pokey.  
<P>
<b>Are you related to Violet, the makers of Nabaztag?</b><br>
No.
<P>
<b>Are you running OpenNab?</b><br>
No.  I wanted to run the original source code as delivered by Violet and implement my own backend 
solution for the most flexibility.  Also, OpenNab was not setup to be self hosting at that time.
<P>
<b>Is your service open source?</b><br>
Yes and no.  The rabbit executes the original rabbit code released by Violet.  You can see that 
<a href="nominal.010110.mtl">here</a>.  I have only made a few changes to this code.  The server side,
the side you are seeing now, I wrote completely from scratch.  The database and application
code that I designed and implemented from scratch is not open source.  However, most of it exists
to support the user interface that you see.
<P>
<b>Will the V1.0 rabbits ever be supported?</b><br>
Yes!  Bad Boy Bunny sent me a V1 and thanks to him V1s are now running in a very limited mode.  More features will be added in the future.  
<P>
<b>Are you going to add TTS so we can message other rabbits?</b><br>
You can send speach to your rabbit from the update page.  Currently Google TTS is used for this and it is limited to 100 characters.
<P>
<b>What about streaming?  </b><br>
Currently there is an issue with streaming anything over 80k in size or the sound breaks up when streamed.  
I will try to do some
more research on this.  What I really need to do is plug in to the diagnostic port on the rabbit but 
I am reluctant to tear into my one and only rabbit.  This issue does not occur when using the
emulator.
<P>
<b>Why doesn't my weather work? </b><br>
To setup weather you need to lookup the Yahoo weather code as described in the <a href="weather_setup.htm">Setup
Guide</a>.  This is not a postal code but a code provided by Yahoo.  For example, the weather code
for London is 44418 and that is what you enter.  If this is wrong, you won't get weather.
<P>
Weather lights get their info from a successful weather forecast so you must have at least one weather
forecast per day to get weather lights.
<P>
<b>What other features are you going to add in the future?</b><br>
I add features as I dream them up.  Some of them came from you!  If you have any suggestions, please post to the 
<a href="forumEntry.php">Forum</a>.
<P>
<b>Why does the clock play twice?</b><br>
The clock you hear at the top of the hour consists of two messages.  The first is always the name of the hour
e.g. noon, the second is a random message for the hour from the collection of time related messages.  
<P>
If you would prefer to only have the time announced, you can check the "single clock behavior" check box on the update rabbit page.
<P>
<b>Are you on Twitter?</b><br>
Yes.  Follow nabaztaglives.
<P>
<b>Can we send money?</b><br>
Yes, there is a donate link on the top page to help pay for hosting fees.
<P>
<b>Do you have any technical info regarding the V1 rabbit?</b><br>
Yes, you can read about that <a href="faq_v1.htm">here</a>.
<P>
<b>Is there an API we can use to send commands to the rabbit?</b><br>
Yes, there is a basic one which you can read about <a href="apiinfo.htm">here</a>.
