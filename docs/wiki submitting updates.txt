Submitting updates
------------------
First please set your tab key to emit four spaces.  I'm trying to keep tabs out of the source code.

Make sure you pull the latest code:

    git pull

If you are adding new functionality, please update the issues.htm found in the www folder so we know what you did.  

If you're working on a Mac, please delete all of the pesky Finder files that get created when you open a folder in Finder:

    find . -name ".DS_Store" -delete 

To check what you've changed you can do:

    git status

If you haven't done so already, please configure your info:

    git config --global user.name "Name"
    git config --global user.email "your_email@youremail.com"

Next create a branch to do your work:

    git checkout -b mywork

And commit when finished:

    git add file1 file2 file3
    git commit

Add a commit message:

    git commit -m 'My commit message'

Before creating a patch, rebase your changes with the master:

    git checkout master
    git pull
    git checkout mywork
    git rebase master

Finally, create the patch:

    git format-patch -M master

You can then submit the patch on a ticket.
