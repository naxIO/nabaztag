For encoding and compressing MP3 files so they play on the rabbit without cracking:

lame -h -a -V1 -B 32 infile outfile

Files should be mono and need to be small, below 50k.  If still too large, you can try this:

lame -h -a -V1 -B 24 infile outfile

or:

lame -h -a -V1 -B 16 infile outfile

You can go lower but the sound quality suffers.
