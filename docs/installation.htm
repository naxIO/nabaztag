<h2>NabaztagLives</h2>
NabaztagLives has been tested on the Raspberry Pi "Wheezy" (NOOBS) distribution and has the following dependencies:
<P>
<li>Apache
<li>PHP
<li>MySQL
<li>Lame
<li>Mp3Wrap
<P>
At the time of this writing I am running with the following versions:<br>
<li>Apache/2.2.22 (Debian)
<li>PHP 5.4.4-14+deb7u3 (cli) (built: Jul 18 2013 01:01:56) 
<li>mysql  Ver 14.14 Distrib 5.5.31, for debian-linux-gnu (armv7l)
<li>LAME 32bits version 3.99.5 (http://lame.sf.net)
<li>Mp3Wrap Version 0.5 (2003/Jan/16)
<P>
You can install them on your Raspberry Pi by running the following commands:
<pre>
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get upgrade

    sudo apt-get install apache2 php5 php5-curl libapache2-mod-php5
    sudo service apache2 restart

    sudo apt-get install mysql-server mysql-client php5-mysql

    sudo apt-get install lame

    sudo apt-get install mp3wrap
</pre>
<P>
When you install MySql, it will prompt you to set a root password.  You'll need that password to setup the database below.  
<P>
When you install Apache, it may kick out an error that says <i>Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name.</i>  You can fix this by setting the server's name to localhost.  While we're there, we need to enable the .htaccess override:
<pre>
    sudo vi /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
</pre>
Scroll to the end of the file and insert:
<pre>
    ServerName localhost
</pre>
<P>
If you have a V1 rabbit, you'll need to set the override:
<pre>
    sudo vi /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default
</pre>
<P>
Change the AllowOverride to <i>All</i> so it looks like this:
<pre>
    &lt;Directory /var/www/&gt;
            Options -Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
            AllowOverride All
            Order allow,deny
            allow from all
    &lt;/Directory&gt;
</pre>

Save the file and exit.  Then do:
<pre>
    sudo apachectl restart
</pre>
<h3>Installing the application</h3>
The easiest way to get setup is to use git to get the latest code.  First create a directory on your Pi to hold the project, navigate to it, and then do:
<P>
<pre>
    git clone     
</pre>
<P>
This will create a folder named NabaztagLives on your Pi.  
<P>
In my case I only have one website on my Pi so I installed NabaztagLives to the root website.  If you don't want to do this, now is the time to create a folder inside /var/www.  Otherwise copy the contents of the www directory to the root of your Pi's web server which is /var/www:
<pre>
    sudo cp -R www /var
</pre>
<P>
Next open the db folder on your Pi and build the database. Enter your MySql root password when prompted:
<pre>
    sudo ./db_setup.sh
</pre>
<P>
Next we need to move the db info file to the right place.  This is also where logs go:
<pre>
    sudo cp -R ./etc /var
</pre>
Next we need to set some ownership properties or our rabbit will be very quiet:
<pre>
    sudo chown www-data:www-data /var/www/vl/hutch
    sudo chown www-data:www-data /var/etc
</pre>
Almost done!  Get your IP address:
<pre>
    ifconfig | grep addr
</pre>
This should bring back an IP that starts with 192.  Copy it and open a browser.  If you are on your Pi type in localhost for the address.  If you are remotely connect, type in the IP you wrote down.  The site should be displayed.  If you didn't get an IP that means your wifi is hosed and I don't know how you got this far.  
<P>
You're finished!  All you need to do now is setup your rabbit.  If you need help with that, click on the Setup Info button on the NabaztagLives website that's now running on your Pi.  When you're done, be sure and click the "Update Rabbit" button to see all the features.
<P>
<h3>I get a warning about a locator record</h3>
If you see this on the home page then you need to change the IP addresses in /www/locate.jsp to your server's IP address (the one displayed at the bottom of the page).
<P>
<h3>My rabbit doesn't work</h3>
That's what I said!  Check the error log, there's a button for it on the site.  Click "reset" to reset it.  Make sure you have setup your rabbit to do things!  Set the idle behavior to PacMan Lights so you don't have to wait to see if it works.  If you need help, you can always <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/nabaztaglives/discussion/brokenrabbit/">post to the forum</a>.

<h2>New to Raspberry?</h2>
If you are setting up your Raspberry Pi for the first time, you can get instructions from <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/quick-start-guide-v2_1.pdf">here</a>.
<P>
I used the NOOBS image and deleted all but the "Wheezy" files before copying it to the SD card.  That saves room and speeds the installation assuming you don't intend to run the other distros.
<P>
I recommend a 4 GB class 10 SD card from a name brand like Sandisk.  The Model B has a 25 MB/s max write speed so you want something that can write that fast.  Always check to see if your equipment is supported by checking to see if it <a href="http://elinux.org/RPi_VerifiedPeripherals">works first</a>. Just remember that if you want to make a backup of the SD card, you will need whatever size card you have available on your machine.  So if you have a 16 GB card, you will need 16 GB free space on your drive.   NabaztagLives consumes less than 100 MB.
