NabaztagLives has been tested on the Raspberry Pi "Wheezy" (NOOBS) distribution and has the following dependencies:

* Apache
* PHP
* MySQL
* Lame
* Mp3Wrap

At the time of this writing I am running with the following versions:

* Apache/2.2.22 (Debian)
* PHP 5.4.4-14+deb7u3 (cli) (built: Jul 18 2013 01:01:56)
* mysql Ver 14.14 Distrib 5.5.31, for debian-linux-gnu (armv7l)
* LAME 32bits version 3.99.5 (http://lame.sf.net)
* Mp3Wrap Version 0.5 (2003/Jan/16)

You can install them on your Raspberry Pi by running the following commands:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get upgrade

    sudo apt-get install apache2 php5 php5-curl libapache2-mod-php5
    
    sudo apt-get install mysql-server mysql-client php5-mysql

    sudo apt-get install lame

    sudo apt-get install mp3wrap

When you install MySql, it will prompt you for a root password.  You'll need that to setup the database below.

When you install Apache, it may kick out an error that says *Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name*. You can fix this by setting the server's name to localhost:

    sudo vi /etc/apache2/apache2.conf

Scroll to the end of the file and insert:

    ServerName localhost

Save the file and exit. Then do:

    sudo apachectl restart

Installing the application
--------------------------
Easiest way to get setup, use git to get the latest code. First create a directory on your Pi to hold the project and then do:

    git clone     

This will create a folder named NabaztagLives on your Pi. Open it.

In my case I only have one website on my Pi so I installed NabaztagLives to the root website. If you don't want to do this, now is the time to create a folder inside /var/www. Otherwise copy the contents of the www directory to the root of your Pi's web server which is /var/www:

    sudo cp -R www /var

Next we need to change the ownership of the files we just copied.  This assumes you're logging in to your Raspberry Pi as Pi:

    sudo chown -R pi:pi /var/www

Next open the db folder on your Pi and build the database. The password it prompts you for is your MySql root password:

    sudo ./db_setup.sh

Next we need to move the db info file to the right place.  This is also where the logging occurs:

    sudo cp -R ./etc /var

Almost done! Get your IP address:

    ifconfig | grep addr

You should get an IP that starts with 192. Copy that and open a browser. If you are on your Pi type in localhost for the address. If you are remotely connect, type in the IP you wrote down. The site should be displayed. If you didn't get an IP that means your wifi is hosed and I don't know how you got this far.

You're finished! All you need to do now is setup your rabbit. If you need help with that, click on the Setup Info button on the NabaztagLives website that's now running on your Pi. When you're done, be sure and click the "Update Rabbit" button to see all the features.

My rabbit doesn't work
----------------------
That's what I said! Check the error log, there's a button for it on the site. Click "reset" to reset it. Make sure you have setup your rabbit to do things! Set the idle behavior to PacMan Lights so you don't have to wait to see if it works. The other common problem is permission issues which should kick out to the error log in /var/etc.

New to Raspberry?
=================
If you are setting up your Raspberry Pi for the first time, you can get instructions from <http://www.raspberrypi.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/quick-start-guide-v2_1.pdf>.

I used the NOOBS image and deleted all but the "Wheezy" files before copying it to the SD card. That saves room and speeds the installation assuming you don't intend to run the other distros.

I recommend a 4 GB class 10 SD card from a name brand like Sandisk. The Model B has a 25 MB/s max write speed so you want something that can write that fast. Always check to see if your equipment is supported by checking to see if it works first by going to <http://elinux.org/RPi_VerifiedPeripherals>. 

Just remember that if you want to make a backup of the SD card, you will need whatever size card you have available on your machine. So if you have a 16 GB card, you will need 16 GB free space on your drive. NabaztagLives consumes less than 100 MB.

Setup hidden wifi
-----------------
    wpa_passphrase Your-Wifi-SSID Your-Password
    sudo vi /etc/network/interfaces

Make it look like this:

    auto lo

    iface lo inet loopback
    iface eth0 inet dhcp

    auto wlan0
    allow-hotplug wlan0
    iface wlan0 inet dhcp

       wpa-ap-scan 1
       wpa-key-mgmt WPA-PSK
       wpa-proto RSN WPA
       wpa-pairwise CCMP TKIP
       wpa-group CCMP TKIP
       wpa-ssid "Your Wifi SSID"
       wpa-psk Your-PSK-Value-that-you-got-from-running-wpa_passphrase 

    iface default inet dhcp
